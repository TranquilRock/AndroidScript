## Notes for developers

### For the sdk path, you should have a file `local.properties` in the root folder, for example:

```
  ## This file must *NOT* be checked into Version Control Systems,
  # as it contains information specific to your local configuration.
  #
  # Location of the SDK. This is only used by Gradle.
  # For customization when using a Version Control System, please read the
  # header note.
